## New repo who dis?

Have a peek around. You'll find a few projects, some of the MERN flavor, maybe a dash of PERN. That's right! I identify as database fluid! And I've dabbled in a little Vue.

What I'm working on these days:

*🤔 Really drilling in deep on JS concepts. While I've built projects and I'm mostly happy with how they've turned out, I'm taking a short break to to become undeniably, really damn good at JavaScript. I'm also about to see how TypeScript smells on me.*
